# Goal: Create and train a neural network that processes 28x28 black and white 
# pixel images to detect whitch number (0-9) they are.
#
# I also want to be able to write the weights into a seperate file so I don't 
# have to retrain the model each time I want to test it out

# Setup the Neural Netowrk

# create layers of nodes

# Initilize weights and biasies to random

# Load MNIST Data set

# Train using backpropogation
